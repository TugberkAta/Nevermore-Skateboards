<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I wanted to create a e-commerce site to use as a demo for my portfolio to showcase my frontend and backend skill, I also wanted to solidfy my understanding on using NEXT.js meanwhile learn postgreSQL. I am a passionate skater and thought making a skate shop site would be fun and engaging and I was correct!

I learned a lot during this project, I had used nextjs on my latest project but I had yet to use app router which I did for this, it was a rough ride at first but after some itterations I really like using it. And using routes to conditionally render pages have been a great tool for me on this project.

Aside from that this was also the first time I used serverless actions, at first it was a tough task making it make sense but after learning how to seperate the server and client components optimally I was able to create features faster than I would have if I used RestfulAPI.

I also learned how to create layout animations with framer motion, I really like how interactive it looks and feels like.

Additionaly I used headless StripeAPI to create the checkout page and made sure the application would work in a real life setting.

Lastly I learned how to create a search function that fetches items based on searchParams, it sends the param to the backend and fetches the items based on that, I also added a paganation to the search incase it takes more than one page to show the items.
